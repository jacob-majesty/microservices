## Overview

This repository provides a comprehensive example of building microservices using Java and Spring Boot. It includes integration with Spring Cloud for service discovery, configuration management, and API gateway. The microservices are containerized using Docker, orchestrated with Kubernetes, and deployed using Helm charts. Additionally, the project incorporates security best practices to protect microservices.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: The primary programming language for building microservices.
- **Spring Boot**: Framework for creating stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications.
- **Spring Cloud**: Tools for building distributed systems (e.g., service discovery, configuration management, API gateway).
- **Docker**: Containerization platform for packaging microservices.
- **Kubernetes**: Container orchestration for deploying and managing microservices.
- **Helm**: Package manager for Kubernetes to simplify deployment.
- **Microservices Security**: Techniques like OAuth2, JWT, and Spring Security for securing microservices.

---

## Features

- **Service Discovery**: Using Spring Cloud Netflix Eureka or Consul.
- **API Gateway**: Built with Spring Cloud Gateway.
- **Configuration Management**: Centralized configuration using Spring Cloud Config.
- **Containerization**: Docker images for each microservice.
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes manifests for deploying microservices.
- **Helm Charts**: Pre-configured Helm charts for easy deployment.
- **Security**: OAuth2, JWT, and Spring Security for securing APIs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Java JDK 17 or higher
- Maven or Gradle
- Docker
- Kubernetes (Minikube or a Kubernetes cluster)
- Helm
- IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. Build the project:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

3. Build Docker images:
   ```bash
   docker-compose build
   ```

## Documentation

```
### OpenAPI Documentation
Access the API documentation after running the application:
- **Swagger UI**: `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html`
- **OpenAPI JSON**: `http://localhost:8080/v3/api-docs`
```

---

## Running the Microservices

### Local Development

1. Start the services using Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

2. Access the services:
   - Eureka Dashboard: `http://localhost:8761`
   - API Gateway: `http://localhost:8080`

### Docker

1. Build Docker images:
   ```bash
   docker-compose build
   ```

2. Run the containers:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

### Kubernetes

1. Start Minikube (if using local Kubernetes):
   ```bash
   minikube start
   ```

2. Apply Kubernetes manifests:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f kubernetes/
   ```

3. Access the services:
   - Use `kubectl get services` to find the external IPs.

### Helm

1. Install Helm charts:
   ```bash
   helm install microservices helm/
   ```

2. Upgrade Helm charts:
   ```bash
   helm upgrade microservices helm/
   ```

## Microservices Security

This project includes the following security features:

- **OAuth2**: For authentication and authorization.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: For stateless authentication.
- **Spring Security**: For securing endpoints and role-based access control.

To enable security, configure the `application.yml` files in each microservice with the appropriate security settings.
